This project is developed under Eclipse using Web Tools Platform (http://www.eclipse.org/webtools/).

Because this project is open source one and of small size it seems to be illogical
to place third-party libraries inside this project.

You need to register Apache Tomcat 5.5 Server under name "tomcat5.5"

In order to build/develop this project using Eclipse you need to place following libraries (jar-files)
into /spsc_web/WebContent/WEB-INF/lib:

scala-library.jar                  (http://scala-lang.org)
lift-webkit-0.7.jar                (http://scala-tools.org/repo-releases/net/liftweb/lift-webkit/0.7/lift-webkit-0.7.jar)
log4j-{version}.jar                (http://logging.apache.org/log4j/)
spsc_{version}.jar                 you need to build it from project spsc 
commons-fileupload-{version}.jar   (http://commons.apache.org/fileupload/)

Please note that lift v0.7 is not compatible with Scala 2.7.1. You need to build spsc under Scala 2.7.0.
