Currently scala eclipse plug-in doesn't allow to mix scala and java code inside one project.
As workaround I have created this project. 
You can run test.SuperCompilerTests via eclipse UI.
The aim of this eclipse project is to facilitate 
launch of unit tests (written in scala an compiled to byte code) from eclipse.
