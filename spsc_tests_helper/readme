Currently the Scala Eclipse plug-in doesn't allow Scala and Java code to be mixed inside one project.
As a workaround this project has been created. 
You can run test.SuperCompilerTests via eclipse UI.
The aim of this Eclipse project is to facilitate 
launching unit tests (written in Scala and compiled to byte-code) from Eclipse.
