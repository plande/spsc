Currently the Scala Eclipse plug-in doesn't allow Scala and Java code to be mixed inside one project.
As a workaround this project has been created. 
You can run test.SuperCompilerTests via eclipse UI.
The aim of this Eclipse project is to facilitate 
launching unit tests (written in Scala and compiled to byte-code) from Eclipse.

SuperCompilerTest produces svg files and stores them into spsc/build/test_results folder.
This location is relative to spsc project and hard coded.
Before running SuperCompilerTests suite from Eclipse, you need to set working directory 
for junit launch configuration to spcs project
(${workspace_loc:spsc}).
